<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Shreya Singh, a curious learner who genuinely enjoys understanding how things work rather than just memorizing them.
   I spend a lot of time exploring programming—especially Python, because I love how simple yet powerful it can be.
   Whether it’s decorators, OOP concepts, or even small Tkinter programs, I always try to practice what I learn through 
   easy examples and diagrams. My goal is to build strong fundamentals in tech, one concept at a time, and actually 
   enjoy the process while doing it</p>

<p>I’m also someone who connects knowledge to personal growth. I like improving my daily habits, thinking about productivity,
   and learning smarter ways to do things. Even when I ask unusual questions, like sleep hacks or logical operators, it’s 
   because I want to understand the reason behind everything. I believe curiosity is my strength—it pushes me to dig deeper, 
   test ideas, and not stop until things make sense. That mindset helps me stay motivated and excited about learning.</p>

<p>Apart from technology, I love expressing myself through languages too. Practicing French, building sentences, and exploring
   creative or artistic interests keeps me balanced. I see myself as ambitious but grounded, someone who enjoys both logic and 
   creativity. I’m constantly evolving, asking questions, and practicing new skills because I truly believe growth comes from 
   consistency, curiosity, and a willingness to keep trying—even when things get challenging.</p>
